# Fortra's Cobalt Strike public projects

This repository offers tools and examples designed to help you get more out of [Cobalt Strike](https://www.cobaltstrike.com). Our goal is to support researchers in pushing the limits of what the product can do—building creative, high-impact tools and techniques. 

We're continually inspired by the community, which proves every day that great ideas come from collaboration and innovation beyond what we could achieve alone.

**Happy Hacking!**

## Cobalt Strike Configuration and Customization options

We believe that flexibility is key to effective evasion and threat emulation. Cobalt Strike gives users the power to adapt—whether by tweaking malleable C2 profiles or going deeper with full customizations using our Arsenal Kit and Public Templates and Examples. 

Whether you're modifying configurations or building custom implementations, you have the freedom to shape every stage of the attack chain.
